                                         1   Introduction
                                         Software engineering has evolved through successive waves of methodological and technological change, from struc-
                                         tured programming and object-oriented design to agile delivery, DevOps, cloud-native development, and platform
                                         engineering. Each of these shifts has altered the instruments of practice, the organization of work, and the compe-
                                         tencies expected of practitioners, yet across all of them a stable core endured: human developers authored, reasoned
                                         about, and maintained source code, while machines compiled, executed, and tested what people wrote. The emergence
                                         of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), large language models (LLMs), and increasingly agentic systems marks
                                         a qualitatively different transition. These technologies do not merely augment individual tasks; they begin to reshape
                                         the distribution of cognitive labor across the software development lifecycle, including specification, coding, testing,
                                         debugging, documentation, maintenance, and release management. Code-capable assistants such as GitHub Copilot
                                         moved from research prototype to mainstream professional practice within roughly two years, and autonomous agents
                                         now attempt to resolve real repository issues end to end—reframing the operative question from “can a model com-
                                         plete a line of code?” to “can a system deliver a working, reviewable change?” Recent studies and roadmapping
                                                                                         A PREPRINT - J UNE 12, 2026


efforts increasingly characterize this transition as one of the most consequential changes in software engineering in
decades [1, 2].
This transformation is especially significant because it affects software engineering simultaneously as a practice do-
main, an educational domain, and a labor-market domain. At the level of practice, AI-enabled tools are increasingly
capable of generating code, proposing fixes, supporting test creation, and assisting with repository-level problem solv-
ing, as illustrated by recent benchmarks and agentic frameworks such as SWE-bench and SWE-agent [3, 4]. At the
level of education, the same technologies are altering what students are expected to learn, how they are assessed, and
which learning outcomes remain meaningful in an AI-mediated environment. At the level of the workforce, they are
changing expectations for entry-level competence, professional identity, and the relative value of coding fluency ver-
sus judgment, verification, orchestration, and human–AI collaboration. These three dimensions are interdependent:
if entry-level coding becomes increasingly automatable, then what universities assess, what employers hire for, and
what the professional identity of a “software engineer” means must all change together. Any account that treats them
separately therefore risks missing the systemic nature of the change.
Despite the rapid diffusion of these tools, the empirical evidence base remains fragmented and, in some respects,
contradictory. While some studies report substantial productivity gains, improved developer experience, and acceler-
ated task completion, others find limited benefits, increased overhead, or quality and security trade-offs that depend
strongly on task type, developer expertise, and organizational context. The literature also reveals a tension between au-
tomation and accountability: the more capable AI systems become at producing code or executing routines, the more
important human oversight becomes in validating correctness, robustness, and maintainability. Compounding this, the
field is young, fast-moving, and dominated by preprints, so conclusions can shift between the time evidence is gener-
ated and the time it is formally reviewed. These inconsistencies make it difficult for educators, curriculum designers,
and institutional leaders to draw stable conclusions about what should change in software engineering education and
professional preparation.
The implications for higher education are particularly urgent. If the routine production of syntactically correct code
becomes increasingly automatable, then software engineering curricula can no longer rely on code generation as the
primary proxy for competence. Instead, universities must reconsider the balance among problem framing, computa-
tional thinking, specification writing, verification, debugging, ethical reasoning, and collaboration with AI systems.
This shift also raises important questions about assessment integrity, academic honesty, and the design of learning
experiences that remain robust in an AI-rich environment. At the same time, faculty members require new forms
of support to adapt teaching materials, evaluation strategies, and pedagogical models to a rapidly changing technical
landscape.
Against this backdrop, the present study systematically synthesizes the evidence from 2016 to 2026 to inform the
design of AI-native software engineering education and practice. We ask how GenAI, LLMs, and agentic systems are
changing software engineering work; what the empirical evidence indicates regarding productivity, quality, security,
and collaboration; how education is responding in terms of pedagogy, tooling, and assessment; how professional roles
and skill demands are evolving; and what competency model, curriculum roadmap, and research agenda follow from
the accumulated evidence. To address these questions, we analyze a verified corpus of influential peer-reviewed studies
and organize the findings into a coherent framework spanning practice, education, and workforce transformation.
Concretely, the review is guided by five research questions:

       • RQ1. How have GenAI, LLMs, and agentic systems changed software engineering practice and which tasks
         are most affected?
       • RQ2. What is the empirical evidence on developer productivity, code quality/security, and human–AI col-
         laboration, and how consistent is it?
       • RQ3. How is computing/SE education responding—pedagogy, tools, and assessment—and what does the
         evidence show about learning effects?
       • RQ4. How are professional roles, skills demand, and the engineer’s identity evolving?
       • RQ5. What competency model, curriculum roadmap, and research agenda follow from the combined evi-
         dence?

The main contributions of this paper are fivefold. First, we offer a conceptual framework for AI-native software engi-
neering organized around intent, collaboration, and verification. Second, we propose a multi-dimensional competency
model that captures the skills needed for effective work in AI-mediated development environments. Third, we present
a phased curriculum roadmap that supports educational transformation while preserving academic rigor and assess-
ment validity. Fourth, we derive implications for faculty development and workforce preparation. Fifth, we identify a
prioritized agenda of research gaps to guide future empirical and theoretical work. Together, these contributions aim

to provide a rigorous foundation for rethinking software engineering for the AI-native era. The remainder of the paper
proceeds as follows. Section 2 situates the work in the history of the discipline and prior reviews; Section 3 details the
review methodology; Sections 4 and 5 report the scientometric and thematic findings; Section 7 critically interprets the
contradictions in the evidence; Sections 8–11 develop the framework, competency model, curriculum roadmap, and
faculty/workforce strategies; and Sections 12–14 present the research agenda with threats to validity, the conclusion,
and data availability.


2   Background and Literature Review

Paradigm shifts in software engineering. The history of software engineering is marked by successive shifts in
abstraction, tooling, and the division of labor between humans and machines. Assembly gave way to high-level lan-
guages; procedural code gave way to objects and components; waterfall planning gave way to agile and continuous
delivery; and on-premise deployment gave way to cloud-native and platform engineering. Each transition raised the
level of abstraction at which engineers expressed intent while preserving a deterministic relationship between what
was written and what executed. Code-capable LLMs extend this trajectory, but they also introduce a qualitatively
different interaction model: the primary interface becomes natural-language intent, and the resulting artifact is pro-
duced by a stochastic system rather than by a fully deterministic compiler or hand-authored procedure. Hassan et al.
frame this transition as “SE 3.0,” an intent-first, conversation-driven paradigm in which humans collaborate with AI
“teammates” [5]. In this view, the central challenge is not only code production, but also the translation, refinement,
and verification of intent—a shift that relocates the locus of difficulty from syntax to specification and judgment.
Foundations of code LLMs. The current generation of code-oriented AI systems builds on a sequence of technical
milestones. Early foundations include pre-trained representations such as CodeBERT [6] and CodeT5 [7], followed
by the Codex model and the HumanEval benchmark [8], competition-level systems such as AlphaCode [9], and open,
governance-aware models such as StarCoder [10]. These developments established the feasibility of code generation,
completion, and synthesis across a range of programming tasks and progressively expanded the contexts, languages,
and problem difficulties that models could address. At the same time, repository-level evaluations such as SWE-
bench [3] showed that performance on realistic software engineering problems remains substantially more complex
than performance on short, isolated programming tasks. This distinction is important because it highlights the gap
between benchmark success on bounded functions and operational usefulness in real development settings, where
issues span multiple files, require contextual understanding of a codebase, and demand changes that pass existing test
suites.
Prior reviews and the gap addressed here. The literature has expanded rapidly, and several reviews have begun
to organize this space. The most comprehensive synthesis to date, Hou et al. [11], reviews 395 LLM-for-SE studies
and documents the scale and pace of this growth, mapping models to SE tasks, datasets, and open challenges. In
parallel, computing-education syntheses, including the ITiCSE working-group report [12] and the Communications
of the ACM review [13], examine how educational practice is responding to the same wave of technology. These
reviews are valuable but tend to remain within a single literature—either the technical SE literature or the computing-
education literature. Our review differs by integrating the practice, education, and workforce literatures in a single
framework and by translating the combined evidence into an actionable competency model and curriculum roadmap.
This integrative stance is what allows the contradictions observed in one literature (for example, context-dependent
productivity effects) to inform recommendations in another (for example, how and when to teach verification and trust
calibration).


3   Methodology

We adopted a PRISMA-inspired review process executed through a multi-agent research workflow, with the aim of
ensuring coverage across the main intellectual streams relevant to AI-native software engineering while preserving
traceability, verification, and thematic balance. Four specialized search streams were used to interrogate comple-
mentary literatures and reduce the risk of narrow retrieval. Literature Discovery targeted code-capable LLMs, agentic
software engineering, and SE-task automation. Scientometric Analysis focused on publication growth, venues, citation
magnitudes, and signals of adoption. Curriculum Transformation examined computing-education venues and studies
on pedagogical change. Workforce Impact addressed productivity, labor economics, and human–AI collaboration.
Distributing discovery across four streams was a deliberate design choice: because the phenomenon under study spans
technical, educational, organizational, and economic domains, a single search strategy anchored in one community
would have systematically under-sampled the others.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria. We included peer-reviewed or high-credibility empirical works published between
2016 and 2026 that substantively addressed GenAI, LLMs, or agentic AI in relation to software engineering practice,
education, or the workforce. To capture important adjacent evidence, we also included established-laboratory preprints
and selected working papers in labor economics when they were credible and directly relevant, since several of the
most consequential productivity and adoption results were first disseminated through these channels. We excluded
records that were not verifiable, purely promotional material, and studies that were only peripheral to the review
focus.
Screening and selection. Records identified by the four streams were screened for topical relevance and method-
ological credibility. When multiple streams surfaced the same study, duplicates were removed before final selection.
The screening process was intentionally iterative: candidate studies were compared across themes, and the corpus
was then refined to maintain balance across the three major trajectories of the review—namely practice, education,
and workforce—so that no single trajectory dominated the synthesis simply because its literature was larger or faster-
growing. From the broader evidence pool, we retained the 48 most influential and representative studies for the final
corpus.
Verification. Every retained record was checked against its primary source whenever possible, using authoritative
repositories and publishers including arXiv, ACL Anthology, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, publisher DOI
pages, NBER, Science, and Management Science. A per-record confidence flag was assigned in the companion dataset
to document verification status and source reliability. This step was used to improve transparency and to distinguish
fully verified records from those requiring more cautious interpretation, which matters in a field where a large share
of output circulates as preprints before formal peer review.
The final corpus was synthesized across nine themes and mapped to the review questions through Table 1, while the
complete study list is provided in Table 3. The resulting dataset supports the PRISMA-style flow reported in Fig. 1
and underpins the conceptual, curricular, and workforce analyses presented in the remainder of the paper.

4   Scientometric and Temporal Analysis

The scientometric profile of the corpus reveals a pronounced acceleration in research activity following the emergence
of publicly accessible generative AI systems. Consistent with the field-wide analysis reported by Hou et al. [11],
the number of primary studies examining LLMs in software engineering increased from 7 in 2020 to 13 in 2021,
before rising sharply to 56 in 2022 and 273 in 2023. This approximately five-fold increase coincides with the public
release and widespread adoption of ChatGPT, marking a clear inflection point in both research attention and practical
deployment (Fig. 2). The growth pattern suggests a rapid transition from exploratory investigations to large-scale
scholarly engagement with AI-assisted software development, and it frames the temporal boundary that separates the
pre- and post-ChatGPT phases of the literature analyzed here.
A similar trajectory is evident in computing-education research. The ITiCSE Working Group review identified 71
publications addressing generative AI in computing education, with approximately 80% appearing during the first
eight months of 2023 alone [12]. This concentration of publications highlights the speed with which educational
institutions and researchers responded to the pedagogical implications of generative AI technologies. Collectively,
these trends indicate that software engineering and computing education have evolved in parallel, with advances in AI
capability driving simultaneous changes in professional practice and instructional design rather than education lagging
practice by the years that earlier technological shifts often exhibited.
Evidence from industry surveys further suggests that adoption has progressed alongside capability improvements.
Reported usage of AI-assisted development tools increased from approximately 76% of developers in 2024 to 84% in
2025. However, this increase in adoption was accompanied by declining levels of self-reported trust in AI-generated

outputs. The resulting adoption–trust divergence is noteworthy because it implies that widespread tool utilization does
not necessarily correspond to increased confidence in model reliability. This finding reinforces the importance of
verification, critical evaluation, and human oversight as core competencies in AI-native software engineering, and it
anticipates the “trust paradox” developed in the critical discussion.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the reviewed corpus exhibits substantial methodological diversity. Studies include tool and
model evaluations, controlled and field experiments, qualitative and human–computer interaction investigations, sur-
veys, benchmark studies, and position or vision papers. Such diversity reflects the interdisciplinary nature of the field
and the absence of a single dominant methodological paradigm; it also means that synthesizing the evidence requires
weighing findings produced under very different epistemic standards, from controlled randomized trials to interpretive
qualitative accounts.
The literature is distributed across leading venues in multiple disciplines. Software engineering contributions appear in
ICSE, FSE, ASE, TSE, and TOSEM; machine-learning research is represented by ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, and EMNLP;
human–computer interaction studies appear in CHI, OOPSLA, and TOCHI; security-related work is published in S&P
and CCS; educational research is drawn from SIGCSE, ITiCSE, ICER, ACE, and Koli Calling; and workforce-oriented
evidence includes contributions from Science, Management Science, and NBER. This venue diversity underscores the
broad impact of generative AI across technical, educational, organizational, and economic domains, and it is one
reason a multi-stream discovery strategy was necessary to assemble a balanced corpus.
A persistent characteristic of the field is the high proportion of preprints. More than half of the identified LLM-for-SE
publications were disseminated initially through preprint channels before formal peer review. While this pattern re-
flects the exceptional pace of innovation and knowledge diffusion, it also introduces challenges related to replication,
validation, and evidence stability. These concerns are revisited in the research-gap agenda and motivate continued em-
phasis on reproducibility and longitudinal evaluation, particularly where strong claims about productivity or learning
effects rest on single studies that have not yet been independently replicated.

5        Thematic Synthesis of the Literature
Table 2 summarizes the thematic distribution of the 48 studies across nine research themes, and Table 3 provides
the full corpus with per-study venue, method, and core contribution. To convert this thematic catalogue into an
interpretable account, we synthesize the evidence under three trajectories that cut across the themes: the advancing
capability of the technology itself (practice), its contested effects on productivity and quality, and the response of
education and the workforce.

5.1      Trajectory 1: From Code Completion to Autonomous Engineering (RQ1)

The capability frontier advanced from token-level completion to repository-scale autonomy in roughly three years.
Foundational models established functional code generation [6–10]; SWE-bench reframed evaluation around real
GitHub issues and revealed an initially tiny solve rate [3]. The agentic turn followed quickly: reasoning-and-acting
and self-reflection paradigms [16, 17] enabled tool-using agents, and agent–computer interfaces [4] together with
multi-agent frameworks that encode software roles and standard operating procedures [14, 15] pushed autonomous
resolution rates sharply upward. In parallel, classic SE tasks were re-tooled: LLM-based program repair surpassed
prior techniques [18] and LLM test generation exceeded earlier coverage baselines [19]. The throughline is a migration
of human effort up the abstraction stack: from writing statements to specifying intent, composing agents, and verifying
outcomes. Crucially, the rapid improvement on agentic benchmarks did not eliminate the need for human oversight;
rather, it relocated that oversight from line-level authorship to the framing, decomposition, and review of larger units
of work.

5.2      Trajectory 2: Productivity, Quality, and the Contradiction (RQ2)

The productivity evidence is substantial but not uniform. Controlled and field experiments report large gains: a
55.8% speed-up on a bounded task [23] and an ∼26% increase in completed tasks across three firm RCTs with 4,867

usability studies find no reliable time/success improvement in some settings [27]; behavioral modeling reveals large
hidden verification and editing costs [22]; and a 2025 RCT found experienced developers were ∼19% slower with AI
on mature codebases while believing themselves faster [29]. Quality and security findings are sobering: roughly 40%
of generated programs in security-sensitive scenarios were vulnerable [20], and users with AI assistance wrote less
secure code while feeling more confident [21]. Qualitative work explains the mechanism: developers operate in distinct
“acceleration” and “exploration” modes [26], and adoption hinges on controllability and comprehensibility [28]. The
central empirical lesson is that effect size and even sign are moderated by expertise, task novelty, and codebase
maturity—a finding with direct curricular consequences for teaching judgment and verification rather than treating
AI assistance as a uniform accelerant.

5.3   Trajectory 3: The Education and Workforce Response (RQ3, RQ4)

Education research moved from alarm to redesign. Codex and successors were shown to outperform most students
on CS1 and CS2 assessments [35, 36], and AI tutors approach—but do not match—human tutors on several teach-
ing tasks [37], while remaining unreliable at diagnosing novice bugs [38, 39]. Constructive responses followed:
prompt-based pedagogy and “Prompt Problems” that teach specification [40, 44]; LLM-generated exercises and ex-
planations [41–43]; and guardrailed AI tutors [45]. Learning-effect evidence is mixed and equity-relevant: scaffolded
AI access improved novice outcomes and retention in one controlled study [46], but observational and lab studies
document over-reliance, new metacognitive difficulties, and a “widening gap” between strong and struggling learn-
ers [47, 48]. Faculty intentions span banning to integration [49], and the field’s agenda-setting works call for rapid,
systemic adaptation [12, 13, 50]. On the workforce side, AI reallocates effort toward core coding and away from
coordination [33], diffuses rapidly across the economy [34], and is reframing the engineer’s identity toward intent
specification and orchestration [5]. Read together, the education and workforce literatures point in the same direc-
tion: the capabilities that remain scarce and valuable are those associated with framing problems, evaluating machine
output, and integrating it responsibly into larger systems.


6     Critical Discussion

Three tensions structure the evidence. First, a productivity paradox: aggregate gains coexist with task-level slow-
downs and hidden verification costs, so naive “X% faster” claims are misleading without controlling for expertise and
context [22, 23, 29, 30]. The same technology that lets a novice complete a bounded task far faster can slow an expert
working on a mature, high-stakes codebase, because the marginal value of a suggestion depends on how expensive
it is to verify relative to writing the code directly. Second, a competence paradox: the same tools that lift novices’
immediate output may undermine the deliberate practice through which durable expertise forms, risking an “illusion of
competence” in which fluent-looking results mask shallow understanding [21, 48]. Third, a trust paradox: adoption
rises even as trust falls and measured security worsens [20, 21], making calibrated trust—knowing when to rely on
and when to scrutinize AI output—rather than blanket acceptance or blanket rejection the pivotal skill. These tensions
are not anomalies to be averaged away; they are structural features of human–AI collaboration that any educational or
organizational response must confront directly. They converge on a single educational implication: the scarce, teach-

able human capability is no longer code production but judgment—specifying intent precisely, evaluating AI output
critically, and verifying outcomes responsibly. This conclusion motivates the conceptual framework developed next.


7   Critical Discussion

Three tensions structure the evidence. First, a productivity paradox: aggregate gains coexist with task-level slow-
downs and hidden verification costs, so naive “X% faster” claims are misleading without controlling for expertise and
context [22, 23, 29, 30]. The same technology that lets a novice complete a bounded task far faster can slow an expert

able human capability is no longer code production but judgment—specifying intent precisely, evaluating AI output
critically, and verifying outcomes responsibly. This conclusion motivates the conceptual framework developed next.
A further implication is that the corpus should not be read as evidence for linear substitution, but rather as evidence
for reallocation of effort. The reviewed studies suggest that AI changes where cognitive load sits in the development
process: less time may be spent on first-draft code, yet more time is often required for prompt refinement, output
checking, debugging, and security review. In this sense, productivity gains are contingent on whether the surrounding
workflow is designed to absorb the new verification burden efficiently. Where teams already possess strong systems
knowledge, established testing practices, and disciplined review habits, AI can compress low-value work and expand
higher-value design and integration work; where those supports are weak, the same tools can increase rework and
obscure defects. This is why the literature does not support a universal productivity narrative. It instead indicates that
AI magnifies existing process quality, rather than replacing it.
The educational corollary is equally important. If students are allowed to externalize too much early cognitive work,
then apparent fluency may rise while conceptual retention weakens, creating a misleading signal of mastery. The
competence paradox is therefore not simply about cheating or shortcutting, but about the conditions under which
learning is still effortful enough to build robust mental models. In that respect, the emerging consensus is not anti-AI;
it is pro-judgment. Educational and professional systems should cultivate engineers who can supervise AI responsibly,
preserve conceptual depth, and decide when the machine should lead, assist, or be set aside.


8   Conceptual Framework for AI-Native Software Engineering

We organize the synthesis into a framework with three interacting pillars—Intent, Collaboration, and Verification—
resting on a foundation of durable computer-science fundamentals and bounded by an ethics-and-security envelope
(Fig. 4). Intent captures the upward migration to specification and prompt engineering: the engineer’s primary act be-
comes expressing what is wanted precisely enough that a stochastic system can act on it [5,44]. Collaboration captures
human–AI and human–agent teaming and orchestration, including the composition and supervision of multiple agents
that play distinct software roles [4, 14, 26]. Verification captures critical evaluation, testing, security review, and trust
calibration—the disciplined scrutiny that converts plausible output into trustworthy software [19, 21, 22]. The three
pillars are mutually reinforcing: weak intent produces output that is harder to verify, weak verification makes col-
laboration unsafe, and weak foundations undermine all three by leaving the engineer unable to supervise the system.
The framework rests on durable CS foundations because effective oversight of AI output presupposes understanding
of algorithms, data structures, systems, and architecture; and it is bounded by an ethics, security, and responsible-use
envelope because the documented security and equity risks are not optional add-ons but constraints on every pillar.
The framework is the direct source of the competency model (Section 9) and the curriculum roadmap (Section 10).
The conceptual value of the framework is that it provides a way to interpret apparently disparate findings within a
single structure. Studies of prompting, conversational coding, debugging assistance, agentic orchestration, and security
failures all become legible as evidence about different points on the same workflow. The framework makes explicit
that AI-native software engineering is not defined by the presence of AI in the toolchain alone, but by a reorganization
of responsibility across human and machine actors. Under this interpretation, the engineer does not vanish; instead, the
engineer moves upward in abstraction, taking responsibility for defining goals, constraining behavior, and checking

outcomes. This shift explains why the literature repeatedly returns to specification, verification, and supervision as
central themes, even when the immediate use case appears to be code generation.
The framework also clarifies why durable CS foundations remain indispensable. A supervisor cannot meaningfully
evaluate output from a system whose logic, constraints, or failure modes are not understood at least at a working level.
Likewise, collaboration with agents becomes unsafe when the human operator lacks the conceptual vocabulary to judge
when to intervene. The ethics and security envelope is not a separate layer added after the fact; it is the condition under
which all three pillars are acceptable in practice. Taken together, these relations define AI-native SE as a discipline of
mediated creation: humans shape intention, coordinate systems of assistance, and retain responsibility for correctness,
safety, and accountability.



9   Competency Model for AI-Native Software Engineering

Table 4 operationalizes the framework as nine competencies, each mapped to a dominant cognitive level and grounded
in corpus evidence. The model deliberately elevates higher-order capabilities—specification, evaluation, orchestration,
and metacognition—while retaining foundational CS knowledge as the basis for effective supervision of AI systems.
The cognitive-level mapping, expressed in the vocabulary of a revised Bloom’s taxonomy, makes explicit why the
model is weighted toward Evaluate and Create: in an environment where generation is cheap, the differentiating
human contributions are those that judge, integrate, and direct. Each competency is traceable to specific evidence in
the corpus, so the model is not an aspirational wish-list but a synthesis of what the reviewed studies indicate actually
distinguishes effective from ineffective work with AI tools. The competencies are intended to be assessable and
teachable, and they map onto the curriculum phases in Section 10.
The nine competencies also help distinguish surface proficiency from robust capability. Competency C1, for example,
is not simply about writing prompts, but about translating problem frames into precise specifications that constrain
model behavior. C2 and C3 jointly capture the fact that AI output is only useful when coupled with critical reading,
debugging, and verification practices. C4 recognizes that learners and practitioners need reflective habits that prevent
overreliance on fluent but incorrect output. C5 reflects the emergence of orchestration as a meaningful engineering
skill, particularly as workflows involve multiple tools or agents that must be coordinated rather than used in isolation.
C6 serves as the enabling substrate, ensuring that the engineer can reason about the system rather than only interact
with it. C7 foregrounds the security and ethical dimension, which is not reducible to compliance but tied directly to
safe use. C8 and C9 complete the model by emphasizing communication, collaboration, and adaptability as enduring
professional capacities.
Taken together, these competencies define an assessment logic for the AI-native era. The point is not to eliminate tradi-
tional measures of correctness, but to supplement them with assessments that reveal whether students or practitioners
can inspect output, defend decisions, and operate responsibly in uncertain conditions. This is especially important
because fluent interaction with AI can mask weaknesses in explanation, reasoning, or verification. A competency
model therefore has value beyond curricular mapping: it gives institutions a language for diagnosing gaps, designing
interventions, and tracking progress as AI capabilities continue to evolve.

10    Curriculum Implications and University Roadmap

We propose a four-phase integration model (Table 5) that protects deliberate practice early, then progressively shifts
toward human–AI teaming and authentic, agentic projects. The unifying principle is assessment realignment: because
code-writing tasks are now AI-solvable [35, 36], assessment must privilege process, specification, evaluation, and
defense of work over artifact production alone. The phasing is itself a response to the competence paradox: early
courses deliberately restrict AI on core skill-building so that students develop the mental models that later make them
effective supervisors of AI, while later courses progressively open up to AI collaboration as the assessment focus shifts
from producing artifacts to directing, evaluating, and defending them. Across all phases, a cross-cutting strand threads
responsible use, security, intellectual property, equity, and integrity through the curriculum rather than isolating them
in a single ethics course, reflecting the framework’s ethics-and-security envelope.
The roadmap is best understood as a gradual transformation of academic judgment rather than a simple increase in tool
access. In the foundational phase, the aim is to ensure that students can still reason, trace, and explain computational
behavior without relying on generative systems. This is not a retreat from AI, but a necessary condition for later
effective use. As learners advance, AI becomes a subject of analysis and a collaborator in bounded tasks, allowing
students to experience both the strengths and limitations of model-assisted development. By the time learners reach
systems, SE, and capstone contexts, they should be ready to manage larger workflows in which the central challenge
is no longer whether AI can produce code, but whether the human team can specify, integrate, audit, and defend what
the AI produces.
The roadmap also has institutional significance. It implies that curriculum reform cannot be confined to isolated elec-
tive modules or brief policy statements. Programs need a coherent sequence in which learning outcomes, assessment
designs, and academic integrity practices reinforce one another. That sequence should be backed by faculty devel-
opment and shared assessment resources, because otherwise AI-resilient design will remain uneven and difficult to
sustain. The roadmap therefore serves both as a pedagogical model and as a governance mechanism for curriculum
modernization.

11    Faculty Development and Workforce Transformation

Faculty development. Because instructor responses currently range from prohibition to wholesale integration [49],
institutions need structured, evaluated faculty-development programs rather than ad hoc adaptation. We recommend:
(i) communities of practice that co-design AI-resilient assessments so that effective designs spread rather than being
reinvented course by course; (ii) hands-on training in agentic and tutoring tools with guardrails, building on evidence
about where such tools help and where they remain unreliable [37, 45]; (iii) shared, openly-licensed assessment banks
that lower the cost of moving away from easily-automated artifact production; and (iv) longitudinal evaluation of what
faculty actually implement, addressing the well-documented intention–action gap in which stated plans to integrate or
restrict AI diverge from classroom practice.
Faculty development should be treated as a design problem, not only a training problem. The central challenge is not
merely that instructors need to learn new tools, but that they need new assessment norms, new examples of acceptable
use, and new ways of judging student learning when AI is present. Many faculty are likely to benefit from concrete
templates that make it easier to ask for evidence of reasoning, reflection, and verification. Others may need support
in identifying where AI assistance is pedagogically useful and where it undermines the learning goals of a particular
course. A mature faculty-development program therefore combines technical exposure, pedagogical calibration, and
policy guidance. It should also create space for instructors to share what works and what fails, because the field is
changing too quickly for isolated experimentation to scale reliably.
Workforce transformation. Evidence that AI most benefits novices [30, 31] yet can slow experts on mature sys-
tems [29] implies differentiated reskilling rather than a single organization-wide policy. Junior pipelines should
emphasize verification and systems understanding to avoid an “illusion of competence,” ensuring that early-career
engineers build the judgment needed to supervise AI rather than merely accept its output; senior staff, by contrast,
need patterns for when not to delegate, recognizing the contexts in which manual work remains faster and safer. As
effort reallocates from coordination to core coding [33] and roles reorganize around intent and orchestration [5], or-
ganizations should invest in developer-experience measurement that explicitly accounts for verification overhead [22]
rather than crediting raw acceptance or output, and in secure-by-default AI workflows given the documented secu-
rity regressions [20, 21]. The through-line connecting faculty development and workforce transformation is that both
are governance problems as much as training problems: the durable gains come from institutionalizing verification,
calibrated trust, and responsible use, not from tool adoption alone.
At the workforce level, the evidence suggests a need for role-sensitive transformation. Entry-level engineers should
be equipped to question, inspect, and verify AI-assisted work from the outset, because their value will increasingly lie
in disciplined judgment rather than in isolated coding speed. More experienced engineers, meanwhile, must learn to
recognize when AI assistance is appropriate, when it adds unnecessary verification burden, and when existing expertise
remains the more efficient and safer route. For organizations, this means that talent development should not focus only
on accelerating output. It should also aim to preserve organizational memory, strengthen review culture, and prevent
overreliance on tools whose performance may vary sharply with task complexity and domain maturity. In that sense,
workforce transformation is less about replacing expertise than about redefining what expertise must now include.


12    Future Research Agenda and Threats to Validity

Future research agenda. Table 6 consolidates eleven gaps and directions synthesized across the corpus. The highest
priorities are longitudinal learning and skill-formation studies that follow learners across multiple semesters rather
than single sessions; quality- and team-adjusted productivity measurement that captures verification and maintenance
costs rather than raw speed; a theory of when AI helps versus hinders, expressed in terms of moderators such as
expertise, task novelty, and codebase maturity; validated AI-resilient assessment instruments; and equity-focused
interventions targeted at the widening gap between strong and struggling learners. These priorities follow directly
from the contradictions documented in the critical discussion: each gap marks a place where the existing evidence is
either too short-term, too narrowly measured, or too concentrated in a few contexts to support confident generalization.
Threats to validity. Several limitations qualify the conclusions drawn here. On construct and selection validity,
“influence” is partly subjective; we mitigated this with multi-agent discovery across complementary literatures and
explicit verification, but some relevant work is inevitably omitted. On currency, the field moves faster than publication;
over half of LLM-for-SE outputs are preprints [11], so some venues and citation magnitudes are reported as orders of
magnitude and may have changed since data collection. On internal validity, many primary studies use bounded tasks
or single institutions; we therefore foreground the contradictions in the evidence rather than averaging them away,
since a pooled effect size would obscure the very context-dependence that is the central finding. On external validity,
the education evidence concentrates on introductory programming and a small set of research groups, and output is

(G11). These threats do not undermine the review’s directional conclusions, but they bound the precision with which
any single magnitude should be reported or acted upon.

13    Conclusion
Across 48 verified studies, the evidence is consistent on direction if not magnitude: GenAI, LLMs, and emerging
agentic systems are fundamentally reshaping software engineering by shifting human effort away from code authorship
and toward intent specification, collaboration, supervision, and verification. Although the literature reports substantial
variation in measured outcomes, a common pattern emerges. Productivity gains, learning benefits, and workflow
improvements are achievable, but they are neither automatic nor universal. Instead, their realization depends on
expertise, task characteristics, organizational context, and the quality of verification practices surrounding AI use.
This review identified three recurring tensions that define the AI-native era: the productivity paradox, the competence
paradox, and the trust paradox. Collectively, these tensions suggest that the central challenge is no longer generating
software artifacts, but ensuring that humans retain the judgment necessary to direct, evaluate, and govern increasingly
capable AI systems. In response, this paper synthesized the evidence into an integrated conceptual framework, a nine-
dimension competency model, a four-phase curriculum roadmap with AI-resilient assessment, and a set of faculty-
development and workforce-transformation recommendations.
The findings carry important implications for universities, employers, and policymakers. Educational programs that
preserve deliberate practice while emphasizing specification, evaluation, verification, and responsible use are likely
to produce graduates better prepared for AI-mediated development environments. Likewise, organizations that insti-
tutionalize calibrated trust, secure workflows, and effective human oversight will be better positioned to capture the
benefits of AI while mitigating its risks. Ultimately, preparing software engineers for the AI-native future is not pri-
marily a technological challenge; it is an educational, organizational, and governance challenge centered on cultivating
enduring human judgment in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
